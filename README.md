# Fraud Detection Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based fraud detection model to help prevent financial losses by identifying potential fraudulent transactions.

## Key Features
- **Robust Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, normalization, and transformation for high-quality input data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features to capture distinct fraud patterns.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of a Random Forest classifier, specifically tuned for fraud detection.
- **Model Interpretability**: Utilization of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for interpreting model predictions.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployment of the trained model as a web service for seamless integration with the organization’s systems.

## Data
The dataset consists of:
- **User-related information**: demographics and behavioral data
- **Transaction-related information**: details on purchase and spending patterns
- **Browser and Device Data**: metadata on the user’s interaction platform

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare raw data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Development of domain-relevant features that may indicate fraud patterns.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest classifier and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **Model Interpretability**: Applying LIME and SHAP to understand feature importance and enhance transparency in the decision-making process.

## Deployment
The trained model is packaged and deployed as a web service, enabling integration with the organization’s systems for real-time fraud detection.

## Future Work
- **Additional Algorithms**: Testing other machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks.
- **Enhanced Data Sources**: Incorporating additional data streams, such as real-time behavioral data.
- **Online Learning**: Implementing adaptive models that update as new fraud patterns emerge.
